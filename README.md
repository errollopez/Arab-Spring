# Arab Spring
===

##Abstract
During Arab Spring, the series of events was widely covered and spread through social media. In this report, we analyze Twitter data from Arab Spring and the Hermida Study to analyze differences between four different source types: alternative voices, mainstream media, institutional elites, and other. We will use an array of data mining and text mining techniques to expand on the Hermida Study and conduct classifcation techniques to expand on the data. The results of the analysis suggest that source types and their tweet content. But other significant variables, such as deliveries, total impressions, violence, and tag counts account for the differences in tweets.

##Introduction
Arab Spring refers to a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and rebellions that spread across the Middle East in early 2011. The narrative of the young generation rising against oppresive governments gave birth to revolutions across the Middle East. Numerous factors led to this revolution: political corruption, human rights violations, unemployment, just to name a couple.

  In this report, we will be analyzing Twitter and its importance in Arab Spring. Since it was a youth movement, Facebook and Twitter were widely utilized by the younger generation and helped media platforms and journalists to track and provide better coverage critical events. Our data will utilize the Hermida Study especially Andy Carvin's, a prominent figure during Arab Spring, sourcing of information as well as 2.4 million tweets relating to the revolution.
  
  Our project revolved around analyzing Tweet content such as key buzzwords, content, impressions, and source types. In this paper we analyzed data and created our own sets of data to provide additional insight on the Hermida study on different source types and cross-referencing them to the sample 2.4 million tweets on the revolution. We are able to discren whether the four different source types, mainstream media, institutional elites, alternative voices, and others, provide any significant difference in Andy Carvin's sourcing during Arab Spring. While the proportion of these sources vary, we aim to find out whether if there is an impactful difference in content among the four source types.
